  "readme": "# onchange\n\nUse glob patterns to watch file sets and run a command when anything is added, changed or deleted.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install onchange\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```sh\nonchange 'app/**/*.js' 'test/**/*.js' -- npm test\n```\n\nNOTE: Windows users may need to use double quotes rather than single quotes. If used in an npm script, remember to escape the double quotes.\n\nYou can match as many glob patterns as you like, just put the command you want to run after the `--` and it will run any time a file matching any of the globs is added changed or deleted.\n\nTo use the event and file that changed, use `{{event}}` or `{{changed}}` anywhere in the command after `--`. For example:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -- echo '{{event}} to {{changed}}'\n```\n\n## Options\n\n### Verbose (`-v`, `--verbose`)\n\nEnable if you want verbose logging from `onchange` (useful for debugging). For example:\n\n```sh\nonchange 'app/**/*.js' 'test/**/*.js' -v -- npm test\n```\n\n### Initial (`-i`, `--initial`)\n\nTo execute the command on the first run (no change), include the `-i` flag: For example:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -i -- npm start\n```\n\n### Exclude (`-e`, `--exclude`)\n\nTo exclude matches (`**/node_modules/**` is excluded by default, use `--no-exclude` to disable):\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.ts' -e 'dist/**/*.js' -- tslint\n```\n\n### Wait (`-w`, `--wait`)\n\nTo wait for the current process to exit between restarts:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -w -- npm test\n```\n\n### Delay (`-d`, `--delay`)\n\nTo set the amount of delay (in ms) between process restarts:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -d 1000 -- npm start\n```\n\n### Await Write Finish (`--await-write-finish`)\n\nTo hold the events until the size does not change for a configurable amount of time:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' --await-write-finish -- npm test\n```\n\n### Poll (`-p`, `--poll`)\n\nUse polling to monitor for changes. Omitting the interval will default to 100ms. This option is useful if you're watching an NFS volume.\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -p -- npm test\n```\n\n### Outpipe (`-o`, `--outpipe`)\n\nShell command to execute every change:\n\n```sh\nonchange 'src/**/*.js' -o '> .change' -- echo '{{event}} to {{changed}}'\n```\n\n**P.S.** When a command is used with `--outpipe`, the `stdout` from the command will be piped into `outpipe`.\n\n### Filter (`-f`, `--filter`)\n\nBy default, onchange watch for all events from [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#methods--events). Use\nthis option to watch only for events you need:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -f add -f change -- npm start\n```\n\nYou can separate events to listen with comas if you prefer:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -f add,change -- npm start\n```\n\nOr with spaces:\n\n```sh\nonchange '**/*.js' -f 'add change' -- npm start\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nIncludes [types](index.d.ts) for TypeScript users.\n\n## Related\n\n* [cli-error-notifier](https://github.com/micromata/cli-error-notifier) - Send native desktop notifications if a command exits with an exit code other than `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Copyright (c) 2013 Stephen Belanger\n\n#### Licensed under MIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
